Agents often ask me about converting property inquiry leads, like those from Zillow, and today I’d like to provide some insight into this question.&nbsp;

First of all, keep in mind that property inquiry leads are very different from search leads, pay-per-click leads, etc. Generally, **these leads are further along in the process and are strongly focused on seeing the house they reached out to you about.** Their main goal is to see the home—not to meet with you, or any other agent.&nbsp;

Still, there is a way to approach this scenario that will let you and your lead both get what you want. The key is to hook them with their goal when you reach out. To do this, give them a call, introduce yourself, and ask when they’d like to schedule a showing at the house they’ve inquired about.&nbsp;

After that, you can begin to qualify them. Then, if they’re qualified and not currently working with another agent, you can proceed with guiding them through the rest of the real estate process.&nbsp;

**Understanding a lead’s motivation, schedule, and current circumstances will all be essential in successfully converting them.&nbsp;**

When it comes to motivation, leads with a specific reason for moving will be more likely to go through with the transaction. Therefore, narrowing down their motivation will be key.&nbsp;

In addition to this, also make sure your lead has met with a lender and is working within their budget. This is just one more reason why meeting with leads before taking them on a showing is so important.&nbsp;

You don’t want a client to fall in love with a home they aren’t qualified for. Setting up distinct, reasonable expectations from the start will help you and your client clear a path toward home buying success.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
