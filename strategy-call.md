<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

 <p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Kristy Moore and I’ve sold 200 homes to date.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">Many agents can sell a few houses a year, however top agents understand in order to sell at a high level requires coaching and accountability both of which are provided at Local Expert Realty.</p><br><br>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">Working with Kristy and the team at Local Expert Realty has been nothing less than exceptional. Instead of being thrown to the wolves, like most new agents are, I was given personal training and guidance that prepared me for not just a career in real estate, but a successful one. Even now, I'm presented with daily opportunities to learn and hone my skills through expert coaching sessions. Behind the scenes is an amazing group of administrative staff that process all of my transactions and cater to 100% of my needs.</p>

<p>I couldn't imagine a more supportive team of people to work with than the one I've found here at LXR.  </p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>Ill help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Kristy Moore</p>
