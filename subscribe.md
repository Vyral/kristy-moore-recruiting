<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in (area)?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which includes:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>

</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 200 homes sold in the Northern Virginia market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 200  homes last year and our average agent earns $100,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“Working with Kristy and the team at Local Expert Realty has been nothing less than exceptional. Instead of being thrown to the wolves, like most new agents are, I was given personal training and guidance that prepared me for not just a career in real estate, but a successful one. Even now, I'm presented with daily opportunities to learn and hone my skills through expert coaching sessions. Behind the scenes is an amazing group of administrative staff that process all of my transactions and cater to 100% of my needs. I couldn't imagine a more supportive team of people to work with than the one I've found here at LXR.” <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Lizzie Simons </span></p>
