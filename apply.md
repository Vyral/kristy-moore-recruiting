<p>Dear Real Estate Sales Professional,</p>

<p>Are you a hard working, solution seeking, persistent, positive, sales person who brings their best every day and wants to work around other hard working A+ players?</p>

<p>Our fast growing company offers unlimited income potential and growth opportunities with less risk to driven individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Most real estate agents are not bringing in enough money to pay the bills, have inconsistent income, and are not sure where their next paycheck is coming from.</strong>  In fact, the average income of a real estate agent is $47,700 a year and in 2014 NAR reported 87% of all new agents fail after five years in the industry and only 13% make it.</p>

<p>You can try to spend money on buying leads or paying for things you hope will work, attend trainings without accountability, or work with a company that does not offer high income potential.</p>

<p>Rather than worrying about lack of money, having no prospects in the pipeline, inconsistency, going broke or quitting the business, we can show you a system that has helped dozens of agents reach six figures in annual income consistently.</p>

<p>We offer direct mentorships with top producing agents in the top 1% of the industry, training on high level sales and real estate solutions, free quality leads, and one on one coaching. We guarantee to help you make $100k your first year in real estate and consistent and reliable income from there on.</p>

<p>The benefits of working with us is that you can <strong>earn while you learn, work in a positive work environment, be a part of an award winning team, and have access to all the tools and skills needed to be successful.</strong></p>

<p>For example, John Barton came to us as a beverage sales executive who never earned more than $60K a year in the beer business and within <strong>his first year</strong> as an agent was able to generate close to <strong>$100k in commission.</strong> Jennifer was an <strong>experienced agent and made more money with more freedom in our system.</strong>  Lizzie started with us as a part time runner and <strong>sold her first house within the first 45 days of being a full time licensed agent.</strong></p>

<p>We offer a base plus bonus to start for entry level sales positions, 50/50 split for buyer agents, and up to 80% split for experienced agents with the opportunity to earn more:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Unparalleled training</li>

</ul></p>
