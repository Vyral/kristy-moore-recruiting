Today we’ll be going over a few things regarding your targeted neighborhood, or “farm.” First of all, how do you choose one in the first place? Then, how do you know it’s working? And when is it time to stop marketing to a particular area?

We’ve sent out tens of thousands of postcards to various neighborhoods, and we’ve found that this method doesn’t always work in the long term—even if you’ve chosen the right neighborhood.&nbsp;

**To choose one in the first place, you need to see if the neighborhood has enough houses in it**. It’s tough to build a presence in a neighborhood of only 40 homes, especially if there are only one or two sales each year. It’s simply not worth your time or investment, so you need to look at bigger neighborhoods of between 500 and a few thousand homes.

Next, there must be enough sales in the area to justify spending your money on marketing. You should be looking at a 5% to 10% turnover rate. **Beware of new construction neighborhoods: Turnover rates will look high, but that's not actually the case.** It only looks this way because it’s comprised of new construction sales compared to resales.

If you have a neighborhood of 2,000 homes with a 10% turnover rate, that’s 200 sales, which is enough for you to justify spending money in it.

After sending out your targeted postcards, you want to gauge the response you receive. **You should be looking for a 1% to 4% response rate from your initial mailer**. If you’re not receiving an amount within this range, it probably won’t work in the long term. So if you send out 2,000 postcards, you want to receive at least 20 in return. If you’re not getting any responses whatsoever, do some troubleshooting: Check your website, make sure it’s working, and make sure your postcards were actually mailed (you’d be surprised how often they mistakenly aren’t).

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
