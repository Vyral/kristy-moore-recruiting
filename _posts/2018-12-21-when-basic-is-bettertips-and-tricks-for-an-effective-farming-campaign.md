The first thing we do after choosing our target market is put together what I call yellow postcards. A yellow postcard is a blank, yellow stock, matte-finish postcard with black writing on it. Why do people fight me on this? Well, they think it’s very boring and basic. **But that’s exactly what you want it to be.**

If you look at everything in your mail, you’ll notice that it’s all colorful and high-gloss, so a basic yellow postcard actually stands out. Additionally, **if it’s not heavily branded, you’re more than likely to get a higher response rate.** By that, I mean that you can still have your basic information on it; you do, after all, have to comply with laws and regulations as far as advertising is concerned. But don’t brand your mailers to yourself by putting large photos of your face or company on it. Instead, include a picture of the neighborhood and brand your mailers to the people who live there.

For instance, if you were to mail to "Bryson", you’d put a picture of Bryson on the postcard and write “Bryson Free Home Market Valuation Report” and also include a blurb about how the recipient is going to receive a bunch of great information on this market report. The domain name will also be branded toward the neighborhood (e.g., www.BrysonPrices.com). Have that URL lead them to a website or landing page that is also branded toward the neighborhood. **That way, the prospect is getting information they’re interested in**—they’re there for information about their area, not you and all the great things you’ve done.

You’ll also get a lot better contact information this way. If people think they’re going to be harassed by an agent, they’re generally not going to put in the best contact information. Overall, our contact information, including phone numbers and email addresses, is about 90% accurate.

So once you've chosen your neighborhood(s), have put your postcard together, and created a domain name—all of which are branded to the target area—the best way to send out your mailers is to look up the tax records. Most of the neighborhoods that we farm to have a legal subdivision, so we can actually control our search for addresses within that subdivision.

It is cheaper to do every door directly. However, we have found that it’s not as effective because you can’t target people by their specific neighborhood. People respond to the marketing because it’s directed at their area in every sense, so it’s important to keep that in mind and also not to skimp out in order to save money if you want to get a high return on your investment.

If you have any questions about neighborhood farming or anything else, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
