As agents, our paychecks aren’t set in stone the way many people’s are. Instead, our income fluctuates depending on our level of production. With that in mind, how can you predict how much money you’ll make next year, or even by the end of this year?

**It all starts with having an income-producing plan for your business** to begin with. You need to first determine your baseline, i.e. the amount of money you need to survive. Once you know you’ll be able to reach that threshold, you can start thinking about the level of income you’ll need to reach in order to fund leisure activities and, more importantly, your future.

Most of the things outside of your baseline goal will fall into the category of “stretch goals.” Let’s say you’re getting married this year. Being able to pay for your wedding on your own would count as a stretch goal.&nbsp;

Making income through real estate is all about math. You need to map out exactly how much money you earn per deal on average and, using that figure, how many deals you would need to do in a year to hit your baseline and stretch goals.&nbsp;

For the sake of illustrating this point, let’s imagine you earn $5,000 for every deal you close. **If you wanted to earn $100,000 in a year, you would need to sell 20 homes.** And given that real estate is seasonal, there are certain months of the year you should expect to sell more homes than others.&nbsp;

To break it down even further, I also recommend calculating the number of appointments you need to attend to secure the necessary number of clients to meet your goals. Typically, one in four listing appointments will successfully result in a sale, meaning **you need to go on 80 appointments to sell 20 homes in a year.** There is a potential that more than 25% of your listing appointments will be successful, but it’s better to assume the worst and be pleasantly surprised than to assume the best and be disappointed.&nbsp;

Of course, there’s also the matter of clients who fail to show up to appointments you’ve set. So while you must attend at least 80 appointments to reach the goal I discussed earlier, you need to set even more. Setting 50% more appointments than you need is a good place to start. In other words, you should set 160 appointments to be safe. This will help safeguard your ability to sell at least 20 homes in a year, based on the metrics I’ve covered so far. If your appointment-setting skills are stronger or weaker than average, though, you should schedule 25% fewer or 25% more appointments, respectively.&nbsp;

The likelihood that you’ll secure a client also depends on the quality of lead you’re contacting, though. **Some leads, no matter how skilled you are, simply won’t be as likely to convert as others.** So you’ll need to keep this in mind, as well.<br>Finally, you can’t set appointments if you don’t make any calls. And if you’ve spent any time on the phone as an agent, which I’m certain you have, then you already know that calling leads is a hit-or-miss endeavor. As I mentioned earlier, the source of these leads will play a significant role in whether they even answer their phone, let alone convert. It’s also good to remember that most leads will need to be called 10 times before an appointment is set.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that **you need to have a strong, detailed plan for calling, texting, and emailing leads consistently** so that you can set appointments, sell homes, and, ultimately, meet your income-related goals.&nbsp;

If you follow a specific plan on a day-to-day basis, you should have no problem putting your career in real estate to work for you.
