The first step you should follow before hiring your first executive assistant is to determine what this person will be doing for you on a day-to-day basis. This will help give you a better idea of what your ideal candidate might be like, and, therefore, will help guide your decisions in the hiring process.&nbsp;

For instance, if you’re looking for someone to assist you in sales, you will be looking for someone with a much different personality than someone who you might hire to assist you with paperwork. I highly recommend that when hiring an executive assistant, you choose someone who can take back-end details and paperwork off of your plate so that you can get out there and make more sales.&nbsp;

Hiring an executive assistant should ultimately bring you a return. I know this sounds somewhat dry, but it’s true. **If you’re going to pay someone an annual salary of $40,000, that person’s assistance should allow you to make an additional $120,000 or so per year.** And to make sure this hire is a good investment, you’ll also need to consider how much effort you’ll need to exert to afford to pay them. So while you can hire an executive assistant to allow yourself more freedom, you must also realize that doing so will affect your bottom line.&nbsp;

Another way to ensure that you’re making the right choice when hiring an executive assistant is by making a list of your own daily tasks and how long each of those tasks take. When you decide which of these tasks would be better off delegated to your future assistant, you’ll be able to form a clear picture of how many hours they’ll be working and what their daily duties will entail.&nbsp;

As we mentioned earlier, you must also make sure that this person’s personality matches up with the kind of work you’ll expect from them. Someone who will be working with a lot of paperwork will need to be very detail oriented, for example. You can easily assess your candidates’ traits by asking them to complete a DISC profile when they apply. **I recommend you use the one found on [this website](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/), as this specific assessment will also take the candidates’ values into account.&nbsp;**

All of these considerations are important, but they will only matter if you can actually afford an executive assistant to begin with. Having at least three months’ worth of your future assistant’s pay set aside in savings before you even hire them will safeguard you against potential financial issues that might otherwise arise. This will be especially important if the hire ends up not working out—which, unfortunately, can sometimes happen regardless of the amount of planning you put into the process.&nbsp;

However, **if you consistently **check in** with their progress, take time to train them each day, and continuously guide them as they become acclimated to their new role, they will be much more likely to succeed.**
