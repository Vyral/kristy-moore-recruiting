Today I want to talk about how you can make sure that your buyer wins in a multiple offer situation. Generally, a buyer is going to competing against anywhere from two to 20 buyers, depending on the property, location, and price. **It’s really important to protect your buyer, but it’s also important that you win the deal.**

I generally deal with listings and have to deal with multiple offers all the time. Here’s what stands out to me when I’m sifting through offers.

First, stay in communication with the listing agent. I can’t tell you how many times I have buyer’s agents submit offers and never reach out. If a buyer’s agent is reaching out to me and communicating and showing me they are aggressive and a good agent, **I’m more apt to stay in communication with them and maybe even give them some hints about how they can win against the other buyers. **

As a seller’s agent, I want to make sure that I’m dealing with a good buyer’s agent because I want to keep things drama free for my seller and I also don’t want things to fall apart. **Stay in communication with the listing agent, show them you won’t cause any drama, and show them that you’re serious.**

The next thing you’ll need is a very solid approval letter. Not a pre-approval letter, but a conditional approval letter. This means that your buyer has been through underwriting, has submitted all their documents to the lender, and all the lender needs to authorize the approval is a property. **This allows you to shorten financing and appraisal contingencies, and show the seller and their agent that it would be a smooth deal.**

Also, have your lender reach out to the listing agent. When I know I’m dealing with multiple offers, this is one way that a buyer and their agent will stand out to myself and my seller. 

The next thing to make sure is that your inspection contingency is very tight. A short deadline, and not asking for repairs over a certain amount. You could also do a pre-inspection on the property before the offer deadline, then your buyer knows what they are getting into and you can waive the inspection contingency.

The last thing is price. It doesn’t always boil down to price, but **you should make sure you have some type of escalation clause in the property** that allows your buyer to automatically outbid others until a certain price.

Using all of these strategies, you have a pretty good chance of winning the deal. I get multiple offers on my listing all the time and if an agent comes in with all of the above criteria, they’re generally going to win the home.

If you have any questions about anything I discussed or anything about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
