When attending a buyer appointment, it can be difficult to know exactly what to say. While building rapport is the first and most critical step any agent should take during such meetings, it isn’t something that comes easily to everyone.&nbsp;

Thankfully, we’ve got an easy trick to share with you today that should make this process a little easier. All it takes to become a rapport-building pro is remembering the acronym “FORD.”&nbsp;

**FORD stands for family, occupation, recreation, and dreams—four bread-and-butter topics that are sure to help you jump-start a relationship with any client.**&nbsp;

Each of these topics will be closely tied to clients’ real estate goals, but the first (family) will play an especially significant role in both your initial conversation and their transaction, in general. There are a number of family-related reasons a person may be choosing to move, whether the client has a child on the way and needs more space or is looking to downsize as their college-aged kid prepares to fly the nest.&nbsp;

The next topic, occupation, will also tell you a lot about a client and their real estate goals—**it can shed light on their income, their lifestyle, their commute, and even their personality profile.** A teacher with an “S” type personality will be a much different client than an accountant with a “high C” type personality.&nbsp;

Third, you should bring the conversation around to the client’s recreational preferences. This will help you suss out whether there are any certain amenities they might like to be near or in their new home, such as a park, swimming pool, gym, or hiking trail. In addition to this, being aware of their hobbies and interests will also help you out when it comes time to give them gifts when following up to gain referral business.&nbsp;

Finally, don’t forget to ask about their dreams. Some buyers may plan to turn the home they’re purchasing now into an investment property down the line, and some sellers may plan to use the funds from their sale to travel. **Knowing what a client’s goals are will help inform the way you treat their transaction.** The bottom line is that knowing who your clients are as people and what they want from their real estate transaction is critical to their (and your) success.&nbsp;
