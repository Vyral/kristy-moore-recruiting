Sometimes, buyers are relocating and have to buy a home quickly, meaning they don’t have the chance to view a home before purchasing it. **So how do you sell a home to a buyer who can’t stop in to see it?** Here’s what you need to understand.

You need to be at their beck and call; **you must both respond to them and be able look at potential properties quickly.** You don’t want to miss any opportunities for your buyer, and you want to get them into a house within their time frame. You’ll likely be dealing with someone in a different time zone, so set up times to talk that work for both of you—you don’t want to be called while you’re asleep and vice versa.

Once you’ve found properties that meet their criteria, show them the property either through a Facetime call or a recorded video. While shooting video, **point out both good features and defects**—even if the pictures online look great, that may not be the case in person.

You want to talk to buyers about your strategy up front when you’re consulting with them. **Explain to them how you’ll handle deficiencies, and educate them on what’s going on in the market.** They need to know the moving parts, such as hot/cold markets, multiple offers, negotiation, increased prices, etc. Do this consultation through video chat, or if that’s not available, through phone.

They will most likely be doing a home inspection without being there. Use an inspector who is well educated on inspection items and specialists who can find additional issues. Shoot a video summary with the inspector, who can tell the buyer directly what’s wrong (or isn’t wrong) with the property. Photos of these problems and a detailed report are also important to share with your buyer. **The more you can show, the better.** If your buyer has any friends or family in the area, it’s also good for them to provide their opinions on potential homes.&nbsp;

Another thing to consider about overseas buyers is their cash position. If they’re bringing money, it can get caught up in the treasury or they can have issues getting it released. **It’s important that the funds are in the US and are seasoned in their bank account.** This is the No. 1 problem we have with overseas buyers—getting their funds from there to here in order to close on time. Let their lender know about this in order to prepare, as well.&nbsp;
