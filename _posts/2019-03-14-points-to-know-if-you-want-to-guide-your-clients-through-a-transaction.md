After a deal goes under contract, the part of the deal called transaction management can begin.

**The first thing that people need to do for this stage of the process is to get a copy of the contract, complete with all relevant deadlines.** This is so that everyone in the transaction understands exactly what they need to signed, as well as all the important dates they need to pay attention to. You’d be surprised at how many people have no idea what they signed, since they didn’t read the contract, and therefore don’t know what comes next.

When you send an email with all the details of the transactions and the deadlines, it’s important to let them know what the next phase of the process is going to be. People are always thinking about what’s next, and it will keep you from getting late-night phone calls from clients wondering about what’s happening with their deal.

**The first thing you’ll usually have to do after getting the contract is schedule an inspection.** If you’re on the seller side, you’ll need to let them know when the inspection is, as well as inform them what comes after the inspection is done—What are the negotiation timelines? What is the strategy? What can they reasonably expect from the inspection?

If you’re on the buyer side, you’ll want to inform them about the expectations and the process, as well, but they also have to attend the inspection. If they don’t, it’s important that you do some type of video with the inspector during the process so you can get a good synopsis that comes with pictures or video. Written reports are generally hard to read and can be very confusing, which isn’t good from a buyer’s standpoint if they don’t understand exactly what’s wrong with the property.

Next, make sure to let your clients know what their deadlines are regarding financing and appraisal. In Virginia, if they don’t apply for a mortgage within seven days, they’re technically in default of the contract, so be sure they get their loan and insurance applications done right away. Otherwise, it could affect their transaction.

**It’s also important that the buyer understands they should avoid major purchases**, like a new car, furniture set, or anything else that would affect their credit, during the transaction. They should also avoid changing the terms of the financing—if they do and the seller doesn’t agree to it, the buyer is putting their deal on the line.&nbsp;

In addition to your clients, you also need to understand the contract. Many agents don’t really even know what the contract says or how it works. For instance, the financing deadline stays on the contract until it’s removed; a lot of sellers think that when the financing date is done, it’s done—but it’s really not. Unless the seller delivers notice to the buyer, that contingency can stay on the contract all the way to closing.

For our part, once the financing contingency is over from the seller’s standpoint, we issue a notice to the buyer to make sure the buyer remove their financing, or that if they don’t, the financing is automatically removed within three days.

From the buyer’s perspective, we just keep it on as long as we can until the seller’s agent tries to get us to remove it—then, we still keep in on until they deliver us notice or get really angry.

**It’s important to understand which contingencies fall off the contract, as well as which ones stay on the contract**. Appraisals also stay on the contract, especially if it involves an FHA or VA loan. Home inspection contingencies fall off at the deadline, so if you don’t get the addendum requesting the repairs and the report to the agent by the deadline, you no longer have a home inspection contingency, meaning your buyer can’t ask for any repairs or back out of the deal based on the home inspection contingency.

For the association documents, if there is one, the buyer has three days to review the documents. For our process, we order the documents before the property is listed, so by the time we get a contract, we already have those documents ready for the buyer to review. Most agents don’t do this, so if you’re representing the buyer, you mostly likely won’t get those association documents until you’re well into the contract. Getting those ahead of time means your buyer will have all that time, plus three days, to back out of the deal for any reason.

There are other contingencies that can appear in a contract, but we won’t cover them all today. If you have any questions about this process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
