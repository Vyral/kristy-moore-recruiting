In order to maximize your open house traffic, there are several strategies you can use.

Whenever I host an open house, I ascribe to the “land, sea, and air” type of marketing. In other words, **I want it advertised online, offline, and anywhere else people can find it.**

For example, one way we generate a lot of traffic online for our open houses is through our event postings on our Facebook page. That way, each event we post shows up in the newsfeed of all our Facebook followers in the area. We also do target marketing through Facebook for people who will most likely purchase a home in that location.

Additionally, we promote the open house on Instagram, other social media websites, and many popular real estate websites (including, of course, the MLS). Don’t forget, if a property isn’t on the market by Wednesday, it doesn’t show up in the Washington Post open house list that week.

One of the offline strategies we use to generate traffic is **inviting the neighbors**, and there are a couple ways you can do this. The first is simply going door-knocking around the area, handing out flyers, and personally inviting each person you meet.

If you’re short on time, you can do what we call a “neighborhood open house,” where we invite all of the neighbors to the house one hour before the actual public open house. The reason we do this is we want to know who the neighbors are and who the actual buyer prospects are.

I also want to be able to engage with the neighbors on a different level and let them see all the traffic we get. Odds are they want to look at the open house anyway, so they’ll appreciate being invited separately. Every time I’ve done a neighborhood open house, I’ve gotten another listing from that neighborhood.

Another tactic we utilize is **putting out signs**. We put out giant orange signs that you can’t miss if you drive by them, and we set four or five out on each side of any big intersection in the area. We then make a trail of signs leading to the property. I’ve found that for each sign I put out, I get one additional prospect for my open house.

The first thing I ask a person when I meet them at one of our open houses is how they heard about it, because that will give me a good indication of what kind of prospect they are and how far along they are in the buying process. The people who come to an open house because they saw a sign, for instance, generally aren’t as far along in the buying process.

Lastly, **you need to do as much as you can to make your open house an event.** This is why we refer to our open houses as “grand openings.” Sometimes we even roll out an orange carpet and set up a velvet rope leading up to the entrance. This helps make a spectacle out of it and persuade people to stop by just to see what’s going on.

If you’d like to talk more about how you can generate as much traffic as possible for your open houses or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to help you.
