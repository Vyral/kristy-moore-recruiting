How do you convert Proquest leads over the phone?

Let’s say someone is calling about a property on “123 Main Street” that’s listed at $440,000. **If they press 0 to talk to you directly, here’s how you’d answer:**

“Hi, this is Kristy with Local Expert Realty. What property can I price for you today?”

The reason why you want to say this is that if you don’t, they’ll hang up on you. They called looking for the price of the property, and if you don’t lead with that, they’ll assume they just got trapped into talking to somebody. **Once they tell you about the property they want to know the price for, you’ll say something to the effect of:**

“Okay, while I look that up, I know that property is located in Falls Church. Is Falls Church the only area you’re looking in, or are you looking in other areas as well?”

The reason why you want to ask this question is you want to keep the dialogue moving and keep them on the phone while you’re looking up the property’s information and trying to get a feel for whether the caller is a true prospect or not.&nbsp;

Once you look up the property’s information, tell them about its features and benefits first before listing the price. After that, ask them if that’s the price range they’re looking to buy in. The reason why you want to ask this is that most people call about properties they can’t afford, so **you want to know if the property is out of their price range and, again, keep the dialogue moving so they just don’t just hang up on you after they learn the price.**

At this point, most callers will either tell you they’re only looking in a price range of up to, say, $400,000, or they’re a neighbor who’s just curious what the owners were listing the house at.&nbsp;

If they’re a buyer who claims $400,000 is their limit, you need to ask whether they’re only interested in the property in question or all of the properties for sale in that area. They’ll most likely respond that they’re interested in all the properties in that area. After that, you can refer to your universal callback script, which we use for all buyers.&nbsp;

If they’re a neighbor, your next step should be to ask whether they’re looking for an investment property or they wanted to know the price of the home because they’re curious what their own home would sell for. This question will indicate whether they’re a seller prospect or a buyer prospect and tell you which script to proceed with. You can be sure that most neighbors who call about the price of a property are curious what their own home will sell for and will be a seller in the future. They might claim they’re just curious or brush off their true intentions, but in reality, they’re a prospect.
