When you call your farm prospects after your initial contact with them, bear in mind that the people in your farm are requesting a report on their neighborhood that includes home sales as well as active and under contract listings. Roughly 15% of those people are going to make their move in the market within the next 90 days, and 85% will act sometime after the next 90 days.

The first thing you should say when you call them should be something along the lines of, **“Hi, this is \[your name\] with \[your brokerage\], and the reason I’m calling is that I received your request for the market report in \[your area\]. I wanted to let you know that I emailed that over to you. Is that okay?”**

Why start with this?

**First of all, people want to immediately know who you are and why you’re calling, otherwise they’ll want to hang up the phone.** You need to let them know your name and reason for calling right away so that their guard comes down.

Secondly, let them know that you’re following up on a request that they made so that they don’t feel like they’re on the defense.

Lastly, asking “Is that okay?” is courteous—plus, who is going to say it’s not okay that you sent the information they requested? Ending with that question helps to keep them on the phone and to create a dialogue.

The next thing to ask your prospects is, **“Are you folks looking to make a move in the next three to six months?”** Figure out what their timeframe is, and their answer will help you determine your next move.

If they’re looking to move in three months or less, you’ll want to set an appointment with them. If they’re looking to move in six months or more, you’ll want to ask if it’s okay to follow up with them.

If their answer is yes, which it will be for most people, be sure to ask, **“When would be a good time for me to follow up?”** Whatever their answer is, cut that timeframe in half, minus one month, and follow up with them at that time. For example, if they say to follow up with them in six months, call them in three months. Why? Most people will tell you when they want to move, not when they want to start the process, and we know that the process takes a lot longer than a day. It’s important to follow up with them sooner rather than later so that you don’t miss them.

Remember that it’s important to ask their permission to follow up with them. Most people respect the fact that you’re asking permission, rather than just doing it and possibly annoying them. If they give you permission, your next conversation with them will be much better.

Further to that, be sure to ask, **“Would you like us to send you a monthly newsletter that keeps you in touch with what’s happening in the marketplace?”** They’re already going to get your market reports on a monthly basis, but we also send out a monthly newsletter that gives them tips about what to do and what not to do in order for them to get the most money from their home sale.

Once these questions have been answered, and if they’re still on the phone, make sure you learn what their specific reason for moving is. The main thing to note is their timing, which is why that’s the first question you ask them. But after you’ve gotten through that, ask, **“When you move, are you planning on staying in the area or moving out of the area?”**

This question will let you know their reason for moving, whether it be relocating for work or for family reasons. This opens up the dialogue to give you more information about them. If people have a specific reason to move, you know that they’re motivated.

Next, be sure to ask, **“If you were to move, when do you think that might be?”** At this point, they’re opening up to you, and they’ll likely feel more comfortable telling you the truth than they would have been when you asked the question at the beginning of the conversation; if they lied in the beginning, they may have forgotten they’d done that. It’s also a good idea to ask about how sure they are about that timeframe.

Following that, ask, **“Do you have an agent to help you when the time is right?”** You want to know if they’re already committed to somebody; if they’re committed to another agent 100%, then it might not be worth your time to follow up with them. If they don’t have an agent, or they’re unsure of who they might be using, then they may well be open to a second opinion.

If you get the sense that they’re hesitating on this point, ask, **“Are you open to having another opinion about your house?”** If they say yes, you are generally able to set an appointment with them.

Lastly, you’ll ask to set an appointment. When we do this on our team, we like to give them a no-obligation consultation. Say something along the lines of, **“Would you like us to come by and do an accurate description of what your home would sell for? We can also give you tips and tricks for what to do and not to do in order to get the most money for your home. Additionally, we’ll let you know what you’ll have in your pocket after you pay all of your expenses. Does that sound helpful?”**

Asking that last question is important because most people won’t say no; it is helpful to give them more information and to consult with them. Figure out whether mornings, afternoons, or evenings work best for the clients, so you know when you’ll be able to meet with them.
