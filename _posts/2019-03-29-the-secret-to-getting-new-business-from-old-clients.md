As you know, past clients are one of the best sources of new business. Whether by working with the same client again or getting a referral from them, leveraging these relationships can be a powerful lead generation tool.&nbsp;

**The key is to make sure you’re properly nurturing old clients, just as you would any other lead.&nbsp;**

It all starts with the first time you work with them. When you provide good service to clients, it increases the chances they’ll come back for more—or that they’ll tell someone they know about you and your business.&nbsp;

One important thing to remember as you serve any client is to prioritize strategy over emotion. Buying and selling may have your clients feeling sentimental, but, as a real estate expert, it’s your job to guide them through the deal with success (not feelings) in mind. Above all, **you must act as an objective advisor.&nbsp;**

Of course, showing clients you care means keeping top-of-mind even after they’ve finished their deal. Giving a simple gift at closing ( the more personal the better) will help them to feel that they matter. Don’t be afraid to get creative.&nbsp;

**Even after closing, it’s important that you follow up**. Reach out to see how everything is going and, of course, enter them into a past client campaign. On our team, this means sending them a once monthly newsletter and inviting them to quarterly events. This means we touch each past client at least 16 times a year.&nbsp;

And if there are any clients who work with you consistently, or who consistently send you referrals, make sure to reach out even more often. Meeting these people for coffee, inviting them to lunch, or doing anything else that lets you stay in touch will make a massive difference in your business.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that you should treat past clients as the individuals they are.** Find out their likes and dislikes so that you can better connect with them on a personal and professional level. When you build strong client relationships, you build a stronger business.
