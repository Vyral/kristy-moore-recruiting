  As a 12-year veteran of the real estate industry, I wanted to enlighten you
  about the cash conversion cycle and give you some insight about when to expect
  a return on your farming campaign. When you start a campaign, it will take
  about eight to 12 months to get your investment back, and 18 months to start
  seeing a return. After two years, your return should be fully realized. To
  find out why, watch my latest video.

I have been selling real estate for 12 years, and our team of highly trained professionals, along with our marketing plan, has sold over 700 homes all over the D.C. market. Drawing on this experience, I wanted to discuss the cash conversion cycle and the monetary aspect of having a farm campaign or target market to whom you are actively direct-mailing.

Generally speaking, when you start a new farming campaign, it takes about eight to 12 months to get your investment back. That means if you put $12,000 into it, you will recoup that in about a year. It will take about 18 months after starting to start seeing a return, and up to two years to fully realize your return. **The reason for this is that people who are looking for their home value or are interested in getting information about sales in their area are pretty early in the process;** about 15% of those people will be looking to do something in the next 90 days, and 85% are looking to do something in more than 90 days.

**You can generally expect about a 7% to 10% conversion rate,** which means that if you get 100 leads, you should be able to close seven to 10 of those within that 18- to 24-month period. As far as your ROI, you should be able to expect about a 5% to 10% returnâ€”if you spend $10,000, should be getting $50,000 to $100,000 back.

**It will take some time to get your money back.** However, once you start to make a return, if you do it consistently, you can make really good returns in the long term. It also depends on who is calling your leads; **if you are calling the leads and you are well-scripted and normally high-converting, you will end up at the higher end of the range. If you have an ISA or a newer salesperson calling the leads, you will likely end up at the lower end of the range.** This makes sense: if you are doing all the work yourself, you should be getting a higher return, but if you have multiple people involved in the process, you will generally get a lower return, but you should be able to do a higher volume of business.
