Today we’ll be talking about how to protect your buyer during the process of a home inspection. First, the areas of Virginia, Maryland, and Washington D.C. each have some nuances you need to be aware of and understand.

In Virginia, contracts are buyer beware; **the seller doesn’t have to disclose anything about the home.** The buyer is purchasing the property as-is, and it’s up to the buyer to ensure the home is free from major issues. In Maryland, the seller can disclose everything wrong with the property. However, they can choose not to and instead sign a disclaimer, making the home sale a buyer-beware situation once again.

Don’t settle with just any inspector! You want to avoid the many inspectors out there who simply have a license and don’t know much about construction. You need an inspector who understands construction but also knows when to defer to an expert. **Understand that a home inspector is not a specialist, but a generalist.** They can tell you something looks wrong, but not exactly what’s wrong with it. For instance, they may tell you that an HVAC system is broken but they won’t be able to tell you why or how to fix it.

**Many times, we recommend to buyers that they get multiple inspections.** If they’re buying an old house, it’s important to get a plumbing inspection; a lot of these houses have old piping that is corroded and on the verge of bursting. The same goes for having an old HVAC unit inspected; you can always ask the seller to conduct servicing and inspection to make sure it’s in working order. Keep in mind, if the home has a warranty and the HVAC unit is not working at the time of inspection, the warranty company will not cover something that happens afterward because it would then be considered a pre-existing condition. It’s also important to have electrical systems inspected.

With a roof, an inspector won’t usually tell you how much life it has left or even how old it is. If it does seem like it’s old, have an actual roofer inspect it to determine its age and the time it has left. Many people move into properties and have their roofing fail within a few months.

The best thing to do when an inspector finds a red flag is to call in a specialist to provide an expert eye. It may cost your buyer some extra money up front, **but it will save them much more in the future.**
