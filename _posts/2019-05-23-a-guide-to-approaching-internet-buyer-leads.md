The first thing to understand about internet buyer leads is that they’re leads you got from pay-per-click, Google, and Facebook—not direct inquiries from Zillow, Realtor.com, or your own website. Generally, these buyers are still very early on in the process. They’re not yet actively looking at a home, but rather just browsing online. The reason it’s important to understand this is that you need to approach these leads from a place of customer service as opposed to a hard-driving sales call.

Today, I’ll share a few tips about how to go about converting these uncertain buyers into enthusiastic clients.
