Today I want to talk about how to convert a motivated seller.

What do I mean by motivated seller? Well, a motivated seller can come from various websites; they come from sites like zBuyer, from the radio, from postcard farming, or other online sources where people are looking to sell their house fast for cash or they’re looking for an investor to buy their house.

**The important thing to remember about a motivated seller is their purpose for calling you.** Since they typically just want to sell their house fast with little hassle, you don’t want to approach them the same way you’d approach a normal seller. By ‘normal seller’, I mean someone who is willing to take steps in preparing their house to sell for the most money possible. Those sellers are looking for advice, marketing strategies, and an altogether different type of person than a motivated seller.

I believe in giving people what they want. If a motivated seller wants you to come to their house and make a cash offer, **then give them the cash offer.**

When they call in, or if you’re call them back about an online inquiry, **make sure that you set the appointment.** They’ll ask you questions about what kind of offer you’re going to give them, but you need to be sure to tell them that you can’t give them a price without seeing the house first. Then you can set a date to stop by the house. **When you do, give them two options**: you can tell them what they’d get if you bought the home for cash with no contingencies, or you can suggest purchasing the home as an investor, where they’d fix up the house and sell it for top dollar.

At this point, if they’re still giving you pushback, they may not be a motivated seller at all; they could just be testing you to see what this is all about and whether it’s a scam or not. It’s important to distinguish between a real prospect and someone who is just looking for information. **If they’re serious, they’ll likely set up a time to meet with you.**

It’s really important to understand what their motivation is and the type of property you’re dealing with so you know which way to advise them. The great thing is that most real estate companies won’t offer them both options, which gives them some freedom to do one in case the other doesn’t work out.

If you have any questions about converting motivated sellers, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help.
